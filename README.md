# imageClassifier


Add images to each category folder. Here in this model we are not using any CSV whereas the folder itself is taken as a category. In this program, images are being used from Google Drive (directly mounted). You may need to generate and add a key to authenticate with your drive storage whereas the link for generating will be autogenerated while running the program. Adjust the drive path of the images accordingly.
